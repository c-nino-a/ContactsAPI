# :blue_book: ContactsAPI
PearlPay Internship Training Project

### :sunrise_over_mountains: Background
A classmate of mine referred me to a Full-stack Dev Internship program by PearlPay. Fortunately, we got accepted and this is what we are currently working on as part of that program. 

### :pencil: Description
A Full-stack Web App/API implementing HTTP, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, NodeJS, and Postgres. The objective is to create a Personal Contacts or Address Book Web App/API with CRUD functionality.
Contact details will include the following:
  1) First Name
  2) Last Name
  3) E-mail Address
  4) Postal Address
  
### :dart: Personal Goals with the Project
A lot of what we tackled was foreign to me -- both within the code and in the approach to coding. I hope to learn/attain the following throughout this project:
  1) :brain: Proficiency in the discussed development stack (most importantly the transferable concepts)
  2) :fast_forward: Workflow optimization
  3) :office: A more industry-appropriate approach and mindset to coding
  4) :building_construction: Learn more about the industry
  5) :ok_hand: Develop an output I would be proud of.
